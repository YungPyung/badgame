# ðŸ§  Cognitive Dissonance CLI

A weird little browser game that looks like a command line but acts like something's watching you.

You type. It responds. Sometimes truthfully.

## How to Play
Type commands like:
`look`, `context`, `mirror`, `run diagnostic`, `declare [the lie]`

You'll figure it out.

*Built for fun, glitchy storytelling. Nothing is real.*
